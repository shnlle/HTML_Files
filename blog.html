            <h2 align = "center">Young people’s mental health is finally getting the attention it needs</h2>
            <p>
                The COVID-19 pandemic, a UNICEF report and a review of the latest research all highlight the urgent need for better prevention and treatment of youth anxiety and depression.
            </p>
            <p align = "justify">
                Worldwide, at least 13% of people between the ages of 10 and 19 live with a diagnosed mental-health disorder, according to the latest State of the World’s Children report, 
                published this week by the United Nations children’s charity UNICEF. It’s the first time in the organization’s history that this flagship report has tackled the challenges in 
                and opportunities for preventing and treating mental-health problems among young people. It reveals that adolescent mental health is highly complex, understudied — and underfunded. 
                These findings are echoed in a parallel collection of review articles published this week in a number of Springer Nature journals.
            </p>
            <p align = "justify">
                Anxiety and depression constitute more than 40% of mental-health disorders among young people (those aged 10–19). UNICEF also reports that, worldwide, suicide is the fourth most-common 
                cause of death (after road injuries, tuberculosis and interpersonal violence) among adolescents (aged 15–19). In eastern Europe and central Asia, suicide is the leading cause of death for
                 young people in that age group — and it’s the second-highest cause in western Europe and North America.

            <h2 align = "center">'One Piece': Manga still popular, influential after two decades</h2>
            <p>
                Eiichiro Oda's long-running contemporary manga "One Piece" is the undisputed king of Japanese pop culture today.
            </p>
            <p align = "justify">
                With over 400 million volumes in circulation worldwide, it's the most popular manga of all time, and its ever-growing legion of fans is holding strong 20 years after its debut. 
                Add its popular anime series, films, abundant merchandise and even its own kabuki version, and there's really no question — in Japan, the Pirate King reigns supreme. The story's appeal lies in 
                its contradictions: cartoon-like, exaggerated art depicts a complex pirate world with its own myths, rules and multifaceted characters.
            </p>
            <p align = "justify">
                Veering from comedy to high-stakes drama, the story centers around an idealistic dreamer, Monkey D. Luffy, who leads the search for a legendary treasure, the One Piece, 
                in order to become the Pirate King. Alongside the deeply developed characters and faux-historical plot complications complete with political intrigue, the story blends in fantastical elements: 
                Luffy owes his success in piracy to his accidental consumption of the magical Devil Fruits, which gave him the unexpected power of being able to stretch his body like rubber. "One Piece" is an 
                improbable clash of multiple genres and styles that merge into something that is engaging, enthralling and much more than the sum of its parts. Grab a copy and herald Luffy, Japan's pirate king of pop culture.
